## [Create a CV](https://benture.io/make_cv)

Creating a CV can be challenging: choosing the right template, designing the layout, selecting fonts... We've got it all covered.

Here's how [Einstein's CV on Benture](https://benture.io/cv/einstein) would look like:

Here's the full CV of Einstein in Benture: [benture.io/cv/einstein](https://benture.io/cv/einstein)

You can create a CV, share your personal link or download it as a PDF. All for free. All you need is to fill out a form with your name, education, work experience, skills etc. that you want to show in your CV.

## [Create job postings](https://benture.io/create)

You can create job postings for your businesses. The job posting creation process looks like the following:

![https://benture.io/create](https://i.imgur.com/Oi2Ic17.png)
You'll need to enter the name of the business, the job title, the commitment type (Full Time, Part Time etc.), the application method (more on that later), and the location (which can be "remote" if it is a worldwide remote job).

- The job posts are active for 30 days. You can delete your job posting at any time and get a refund based on the unused time.
- You can extend the job posting's time, which will add another 30 days for each extension.

**We have two offers for your job posting:**
1. **Pin the job posting**
If you want your job posting to appear at the top of all of the job postings, you may pin your job posting for an additional cost.
2. **Fast matching**
We will work on your job posting in detail to find you the talent you're looking for.

# Job Application Methods
As a job post creator, you can use one of the application methods:
- Enter your email, so the applicants would send you an email.
- Enter an URL if you already have an application URL.
- Create a form.

## Forms & Applying to Jobs
You can make a form for the job seekers to fill out.

If you want job seekers to see such a form while applying to your job post:

![Apply for a job by filling out a form.](https://i.imgur.com/9Q9Tf2P.png)

Then you can simply create a form by selecting "Create a Job Application Form" on "Select an Application Method" while creating the job post, and here's how the form builder looks like:
