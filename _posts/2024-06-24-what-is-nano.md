Nano stands out among cryptocurrencies with its notable benefits:

- **Instant:** Transactions are finalized in under a second.
- **Zero Fees:** Sending and receiving Nano is completely free.
- **Micropayments:** Even the tiniest units of Nano can be transferred.
- **Eco-friendly:** Nano operates with minimal energy consumption.

# Nano Integration on Benture

With Benture, you can use Nano to create job postings. Anyone on Benture can create a Nano wallet and use their Nano to post jobs.

**Here's the cool part:** Suppose you create a job posting on Benture and find the ideal match in just a few hours. Even though you paid for a month, you only needed the post for a short time. Rest assured! By deleting the job post, you'll be refunded most of your Nano, calculated based on how long the post was active. This **rapid and fair refund process** is a notable advantage of using Nano.

# Nano wallets

Benture includes an integrated Nano wallet for convenient job posting payments, however, for securely storing large amounts of Nano, we strongly recommend using self-custodial wallets, where you alone hold the private key to your Nano account.

Here are some recommended Nano wallets:

| Mobile wallets                             | Web wallets                 | Multiplatform               |
|------------------------------------------- |---------------------------- |---------------------------- |
| [Nautilus](https://nautilus.io)            | [Nault.cc](https://nault.cc)| [Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com) |
| [Natrium](https://natrium.io)              |                            |                            |

# Possibilities

Given that Nano is a zero-fee cryptocurrency that can be sent and received globally, why not use it for **salary payments**? Businesses and employees can both benefit from instant transactions, eliminating the delays and costs associated with traditional banking systems. Your pay is received instantly, regardless of where you are.
