# 10 Things You Should Know About Benture (General FAQ)

Benture is a job board designed to connect talent with opportunities in cutting-edge technology fields like AI and blockchain. Whether you're an employer looking for the perfect candidate or a job seeker looking for the ideal role, Benture offers a platform that meets your needs. Here are 10 things you should know about Benture!

## 1. Does Benture Only Support Crypto Jobs?

No, Benture supports all kinds of jobs. While our users are primarily interested in cutting-edge technology roles, such as those in AI and blockchain, you can post any job that aligns with our categories.

## 2. What Kind of Jobs Can I Post on Benture?

Benture supports a variety of job types, including full-time, part-time, internships, contractor roles, partnerships, and per diem jobs. Our platform is ideal for roles in emerging fields like AI and blockchain, but we welcome any substantial job opportunity that fits within our categories.

## 3. What is Fast Matching?

Fast Matching is our dedicated service to ensure that you find the best candidates quickly. When you choose Fast Matching, our team works hard on your job posting to connect you with qualified candidates who fit your job description as soon as possible. This service is designed to speed up the hiring process and help you find top talent efficiently.

## 4. How Does Benture Support Salary Payments?

Benture provides a Nano wallet for each user, enabling fast and feeless money transfers. Employers and employees can use these wallets to send and receive Nano.

### 4.1 Is it Possible to Pay Salaries with XNO (Nano)?

Yes! Benture provides a Nano wallet for all users, making it easy to pay salaries with Nano. Employers can send Nano from their wallet to employees or partners (or simply anyone!) by clicking "WITHDRAW." on their Nano wallet on Benture. Tax-related matters are the responsibility of the employer and employee, and we don't have a service for that.

### 4.2 Why Pay with Nano Instead of Dollars?

Cross-border payments can be difficult, costly, and time-consuming. For instance, a remote employee in TÃ¼rkiye might face high conversion fees when receiving payments via bank wire from a U.S.-based company. Nano offers a fee-less transfer solution with sufficient liquidity on major exchanges like Binance and Kraken, allowing for lower conversion costs from Nano (XNO) to USD (and vice-versa) and rapid transactions.

## 5. What is the Goal of Benture?

The goal of Benture is simple: connecting talent with opportunity. We aim to create a platform where employers can find the best candidates for their needs, and job seekers can find roles that match their skills. Whether you're in AI, blockchain, or any other field, Benture helps you make meaningful connections.
