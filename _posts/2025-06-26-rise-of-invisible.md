## Why Invisible is Hiring—A Lot

The world's biggest AI companies (think OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon) are leaning hard on Invisible for RLHF and data labeling work. Fresh investment just hit their bank account, and they've started hiring for real.
But honestly, it's more than just numbers. When a company grows this quickly, it means they need real people, with real life experience—not just "perfect resumes."

## How to Actually Get One of These Jobs

Let's get honest:

* *No one's life fits into a tidy box. You don't have to be perfect, just ready.*
* **Pick the job that fits you—not just the one you think you "should" get.**
* Each company usually starts you off with a short skills survey, maybe a paid task or small project. Be genuine; what you know and what you're curious about both count.

If you can offer a few hours a week or scale up to more, let them know. The more flexible you are, the more likely you'll get fast-tracked.
