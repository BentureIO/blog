## Why This Moment Matters

Mercor continues to lead because they're partnering directly with leading AI labs, paying through Stripe Connect (so you get paid fast), and they're hiring specialists with relevant experience.

They want people who have done similar work before. People with experience in these specific areas. People who have handled banking disputes, manufacturing defects, insurance claims and understand the nuances of these situations.

The pay reflects the value they place on relevant experience. $110/hour shows they're serious about finding the right people.

---

## How to Actually Get One

The application process is straightforward. Submit your resume or LinkedIn profile, do a short video interview to show your experience. That's it.

What they're looking for is relevant experience. If you're applying for the banking role, they want to hear about your experience with customer issues, how you've handled disputes, or your understanding of banking processes.

Don't overthink it. If you have experience in the field, apply. If you don't have direct experience but have transferable skills, consider how your background might apply.
