## The Healthcare Expansion You Need to See

Mercor is making a serious play in healthcare. They've posted **11 medical roles** across multiple specialties and regions, with rates that reflect the value of medical expertise.

### General Practitioners Wanted Globally

**$160–185/hr** for non-clinical work. Let that sink in.

* **[General Practitioner, Medicine (UK)](https://benture.io/job/general-practitioner-medicine-at-mercor-1)** — $160–185/hr

## What This All Means

Mercor isn't just growing. They're systematically building expertise across industries, and they're doing it with competitive pay that reflects the value of specialized knowledge.

**The pattern is clear:** Real experience matters. If you're a GP with 5 years of practice, a sommelier who knows wine, a software engineer who's shipped products, or a political scientist who's published research, there's probably a role here that fits.

**The pay reflects real expertise.** $160–220/hour for medical roles. $130/hour for investment banking. $40–80/hour for product expertise. These aren't generic rates. They're paying for what you actually know.

**The work is remote and flexible.** Most roles let you set your own hours. Some are short-term projects (2 weeks to 2 months), others have potential for extension. All payments go through Stripe Connect, usually weekly.

---

## How to Actually Apply

Based on what we've seen work:

1. **Match your real experience to the role.** Don't apply for medical roles without a medical degree. Don't apply for investment banking without banking experience. They check.

2. **Complete the full application.** That includes the AI interview to verify your qualifications. Most people who start don't finish. Be one who finishes.

3. **Highlight specific expertise.** If you're applying for the Food & Beverage role, mention your sommelier certification or 5 years at Whole Foods. Real experience matters more than generic enthusiasm.

4. **Be ready for a paid work trial.** Many roles include this. It's your chance to prove you know your stuff.
